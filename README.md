# Arduino-FreeRTOS


This is a arduino program that used the FreeRTOS as the programming environment for an alarm clock controller.  

To install FreeRTOS in the Arduino IDE, got to 'Sketch -> Include Library> Manage Libraries...' and then search for FreeRTOS and install.

The arduino shield used for the alarm clock is:  OSEPP 16X2SHD-01 LCD Display and Keypad Shield, 5 V, 16 x 2 Size

This shield can be found on Amazon or is also available in the stor at Fry's Electronics.

A 5-V piezo buzzer is attached to digital out pin 11 and GND to provide the alarm sound.
